# Bike-sales
A track of revenue and profit from a bike sales company

## Introduction 
Following the completion of a 10-day PowerBi course, here's my solution to the capstone project given. The dataset contained 18 columns of data, comprising of Date, Product, Unit Price, Quantity, Unit cost, customer's country, age group, etc amongst others


### Data Source
The dataset was extracted from [Kaggle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TNcQUv_qDCi6L0lLdoNmKZi6ftgfCZ2C/view?usp=drivesdk)

### Data Transformation and Cleaning
Upon importing into PowerBi power query, the data was cleaned by checking for duplicates,errors, blank rows, nulls in Column, and were corrected to appropriate formats.
Age Group and Revenue order tables were created to sort in visuals, these were added to the model

### Insights and Recommendations
* REVENUE: A total sum of over $85,000,000 was generated from the sales of 1,000,000 goods.  Over 30% of the overall revenue generated was from the United States and the least revenue was generated from Canada.  Across the 12 months, December had the highest Sum of Revenue and was 58.93% higher than July, which had the lowest Sum of Revenue at $5,691,960
* PROFIT: A total profit of over $32,000,000 was made from the sales of 1,000,000 goods. Over 30% of the overall profit generated was from the United States and the least profit was generated from France.  Across the 12 months, December had the highest Sum of Revenue and was 58.93% higher than July, which had the lowest Sum of Revenue at $5,691,960. The Road Bikes sub-product category and Adult (25-34) age group are the business key drivers of profit with a profit of approximately $10,000,000 and $16,000,000 respectively.
* ATTRACTING YOUNG BIKERS:  The company should launch a campaign to attract Youth (<25)  by looking into the customization of bikes, caps, and socks  to suit their taste and attract them. 
* ADVERTISING and PUBLICITIES:  To generate more revenue in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and France, new advertising strategies should be developed to reach out to more target audience and plans for attracting discount should be looked into
